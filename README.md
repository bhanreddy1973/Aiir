				<td>- The file `backend/package-lock.json` serves a critical role in the management and consistency of dependencies within the backend component of the project<br>- This JSON file locks down the exact versions of the npm packages that the project depends on, ensuring that all environments, from development to production, use the same versions of each package, thereby avoiding discrepancies and potential bugs caused by version mismatches.

The dependencies listed within this file suggest that the backend is designed to interact with various cloud services, notably AWS S3 for storage solutions and Google Cloud's Vertex AI and Generative AI for advanced computational and AI-driven tasks<br>- This setup indicates a robust, scalable backend architecture that leverages leading cloud technologies for data handling and AI functionalities.

In the broader context of the project, this file ensures that the backend's dependency management is stable and predictable, which is crucial for maintaining the reliability and efficiency of the system as it interacts with cloud services and handles complex operations<br>- This is especially important in a microservices architecture or in a scenario where continuous integration and deployment are practiced, as it helps in reducing conflicts during deployments and across team environments.</td>

				<td>- Manages the configuration of environment variables crucial for the application's interaction with external services<br>- It securely loads settings such as database connections, API keys, and cloud storage credentials from a .env file, ensuring sensitive data is not hard-coded but instead dynamically referenced throughout the application's backend architecture.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><b><a href='https://github.com/bhanreddy1973/Aiir/blob/master/backend/index.js'>index.js</a></b></td>
				<td>- Backend/index.js serves as the main entry point for the server, initializing the Express application, configuring middleware, and defining routes for authentication, user management, messaging, and conversations<br>- It also sets up the HTTP server and integrates socket.io for real-time communication, before launching the server and connecting to the database.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><b><a href='https://github.com/bhanreddy1973/Aiir/blob/master/backend/package.json'>package.json</a></b></td>
				<td>- Serves as the configuration backbone for the backend module, defining dependencies essential for the project's operation such as Express for server management, Mongoose for database interactions, and various AWS and Google Cloud services for enhanced cloud functionality<br>- It also specifies scripts for project operations, notably lacking in test scripts.</td>

REACT_APP_GA_TRACKING_ID=your-google-analytics-id
```

#### **Database Setup**

1. **MongoDB Atlas Setup:**
   ```bash
   # Create cluster and get connection string
   # Replace <username>, <password>, and <cluster-url> in MONGO_URI
   ```

2. **Local MongoDB (Alternative):**
   ```bash
   # Install MongoDB locally
   # Use connection string: mongodb://localhost:27017/aiiir-chat
   ```

### 🚀 Usage

#### **Development Mode**

1. **Start Backend Server:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev  # or npm start
   
   # Server will start on http://localhost:5000
   # You should see: "🚀 Aiiir Server started at http://localhost:5000"
   ```

2. **Start Frontend Development Server:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   
   # React app will start on http://localhost:3000
   # Browser will automatically open
   ```

3. **Verify Installation:**
   - Backend health check: `curl http://localhost:5000/health`
   - Frontend: Open `http://localhost:3000`
   - Socket.IO: Check browser console for connection logs

#### **Production Deployment**

1. **Build Frontend:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run build
   
   # Static files will be in build/ directory
   ```

2. **Production Backend:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   NODE_ENV=production npm start
   ```

3. **Docker Deployment:**
   ```bash
   # Build and run with Docker Compose
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

### 🧪 Testing

#### **Backend Testing**
```bash
cd backend

# Run unit tests
npm test

# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Test coverage
npm run test:coverage

# API health check
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/health
```

#### **Frontend Testing**
```bash
cd frontend

# Run component tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm test -- --watch

# E2E testing with Cypress
npm run test:e2e
```

#### **Socket.IO Testing**
```bash
# Test real-time features
npm run test:socket

# Load testing
npm run test:load
```

### 🔍 Troubleshooting

#### **Common Issues**

1. **Port Already in Use:**
   ```bash
   # Kill process on port 5000
   npx kill-port 5000
   
   # Or use different port in .env
   PORT=5001
   ```

2. **MongoDB Connection Failed:**
   ```bash
   # Check connection string format
   # Ensure IP whitelist includes your IP
   # Verify username/password
   ```

3. **CORS Errors:**
   ```bash
   # Add frontend URL to ALLOWED_ORIGINS in backend .env
   ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000
   ```

4. **File Upload Issues:**
   ```bash
   # Verify AWS S3 credentials and bucket permissions
   # Check CORS policy on S3 bucket
   ```

#### **Development Tips**

- Use `npm run dev` for auto-restart during development
- Check browser console for React errors
- Monitor backend logs for API issues
- Use MongoDB Compass to inspect database
- Test with different user accounts
